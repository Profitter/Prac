# Readme
## This is the practice repo for Profitter used in Github.

- I will be using it to practice git-related operations and different syntaxs like Markdown, HTML, yaml and so on
- I will be using it to practice context-based AI agent training?
- I will be using it as an English output.
- I will be using as the repo for my dissertation for Master's Degree. Maybe :)
